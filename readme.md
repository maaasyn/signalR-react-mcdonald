# McDonald's like system to manage orders in single restaurant

The goal of this project was to create a simple system, which will allow users to add orders on POS, made them visible for the kitchen and finally inform the customer about their order status. As it is done in McDonalds. Currently, the app has no UI, rather than that, it's a fully functional (tiny) service. It has a simple token giver, which authorizes (or unauthorizes) clients to create actions or query certain pieces of information.

TODO:

- User interface
- Configure docker-compose react for production
- Some database maybe?
- upload to heroku
- get cors's together
